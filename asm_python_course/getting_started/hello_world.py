# + is addition
# - is subtraction
# * is multiplication
# / is division
# % is modulus
# ** is exponent
# // is floor division

# Use the variables below to explore some math operations. Let's try
# all of the symbols above. And don't forget we can use parentheses, just like
# in mathHere's an example:
x = 5
y = 10
z = x + y
print(z)
